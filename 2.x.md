## GurbaniDB 2.x Documentation

We've made some awesome improvements in 2.x, compared to 1.0:

* Getting rid of old columns which are no longer required
* Standardizing and simplifying the table and column names
* Moving to just one language table

These improvements should make this database easier to consume in software.

# MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
* Unzip the file `gurbanidb_v2.mssql.bak.zip` which is a backup file
* Restore the contents of this backup by following these instructions: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186390(v=sql.90).aspx

# MySQL
## Setup
1. Make sure you first know the path to your MySQL command-line. On Windows, if you have XAMPP installed this may be: `C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe`. On Linux, this will usually be just `mysql`.
2. Make sure you know your MySQL username, password and hostname. If working locally, your hostname will usually just be `localhost`.
3. Find out the link to your PhpMyAdmin installation. Again if using XAMPP, this will usually be `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.

## Installing GurbaniDB using PhpMyAdmin and the MySQL command-line
1. Download and unzip the file `gurbanidb_v2.mysql.sql.zip` which gives you all the tables you need WITH data
2. Use `phpmyadmin` to create a new database with the collation `utf8_unicode_ci`. You can name the database anything you want, but a suggestion would be `gurbanidb`.
3. Open up a new terminal or command prompt and `cd` into the directory your `gurbanidb_v2.sql` file is located in
4. Then run the following command in the terminal or command prompt, replacing the values with your MySQL connection details (and using the path to mysql we defined earlier in the Setup):
	* `mysql` -u `username` -p`password` -h `hostname` `database` < gurbanidb_v2.sql
5. That's it you're done! Please check your database. It should have the following records:
	* authors - 38
	* languages - 76
	* melodies - 61
	* scriptures - 60403
	* translations - 3,201,359 (Divided by 60403 = 53 Translations)
	* transliterations - 1,328,866 (Divided by 60403 = 22 Transliterations)

__Please Note:__ If you are upgrading from the 2.0 database to the current database you may also want to delete your old tables from your database. Since all the table names have changed in 2.1, your existing tables will not be overwritten, but the new API will only work against these new tables
